#Homework

* For this weeks homework assignment, youre going to learn how to implement new jQuery methods on your own.

* Using the code you have from our session, and the following link to the jQuery documentation http://api.jquery.com/, I would like you to try using the following methods:

    - .addClass() - http://api.jquery.com/addClass/. This will add a class to the HTML div you have selected, and you can also style it using jQuery/css.

    - All Selector - http://api.jquery.com/all-selector/. You can select everything in your HTML using $("*").

    - .animate() - http://api.jquery.com/animate/. We went over this in the session, but try creating a new animation for one of your elements.

    - .append() - http://api.jquery.com/append/, we went over this briefly. .append() moved the selected item to another div of your choosing. Try moving your html around.

    - .click - http://api.jquery.com/click/, add a 'click' event to an HTML element.

    - .keyup() - http://api.jquery.com/keyup/, this is similar to .click but the event happens when you press a key on your keyboard.

* Good luck, and let me know if you need any help :)
