**Homework

* For this weeks homework assignment, youre going to finish implementing the cat

* In last weeks session, we got 10 cat images/gifs on page load

* For this weeks assignment, I would like you to make it so the user clicks (on click function in jQuery) on a button (bootstrap) to load new gifs, and they can add a limit (text box) 

    - Add a button using bootstrap
    - Add a jQuery on click function to that button and move all of your ajax logic inside that function
    - Add a text box using bootstrap
    - Replace the limit=10 in your API url to what the user puts in the textbox
    
Let me know if you need any help :)
