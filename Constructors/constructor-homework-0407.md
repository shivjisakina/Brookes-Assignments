# Constructor Homework April 7th

## 1 You can use your Leaning-Constructors repository we created today

## 2 As a refresher, create a a variable and set it to an array

    * For loop through the array
    * Console log all of the items in the array

## 3 (optional) Write an 'if' statement 

    * Create a variable and set it to 'true' or 'false'
    * Write your if statement to console log different things based on the value of your variable

## 4 Constructors!

    * Create a constructor (You can create a Book constructor aka title, author, etc, Technology aka type(phone/laptop), year, color, or anything you want)
    * Create new objects using that constructor and console log them
    * Add a function to combine 2+ parts of your constructor into a string
    * Console log your new string function

## 5 **BONUS** Adding it to the page using jQuery

    * Take a look at line 16 in my index.html and line 25 of my app.js
    * You will need to add the jQuery CDN to your html (index.html line 16) or you can get it from the bootstrap website
    * Using the .text() method, add your constructor values to the page. You can create a seperate html tag or just add it to the body.

## Enjoy and email me if you need any help! :)
