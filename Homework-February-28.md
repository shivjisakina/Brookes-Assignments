# Homework for week of February 28  

**Throughout this homework assignment, keep pushing your code to github. Im hoping to see more than 5 commits on your repository :)**

### 1

- Create a new repository called 'Homework-February-28" or whatever youd like to call it
- Clone your repo
- Open your folder in the terminal and create the following files:
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - app.js
- Open your project up in Visual Studio Code
- Push to github

### 2 index.html

- Set up your DOCTYPE tag
- Link to your css file
- Link to your js file

- Add a multiple header and paragraph tags to your html and open the file up in your default browser
- Push to github

- Bonus: add classes/ids to your tags and try seeing if you can implement bootstrap into your html. 
    - HINT** your bootstrap CDN or link will go in your "<head>" tag in html 

### 3 style.css

- Style your webpage using a variety of different css styles. I am adding some here for reference, with a link to more css styles you can use!
- Push to github

- [CSS reference link](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp)

- P.S with css styles, the "|" means "or" so you can choose one of the properties and see if you like it.

- align-content: stretch|center|flex-start|flex-end|space-between|space-around|initial|inherit;
- align-items: stretch|center|flex-start|flex-end|baseline|initial|inherit;
- [animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode play-state;](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation.asp)
- background-color: color|transparent|initial|inherit;
- background-image: url|none|initial|inherit;
- background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;
- border: border-width border-style border-color|initial|inherit;
- border-color: color|transparent|initial|inherit;
- color: color|initial|inherit;
- font-weight: normal|bold|bolder|lighter|number|initial|inherit;
- text-align: left|right|center|justify|initial|inherit;

### 4 app.js

- Create 3 variables that are set equal to values with the 3 primitive javascript types (string, ..., ....)

- Create 2 variables and set them equal to the 2 different data types (arrays, ...)

- Console log all of your variables and open up your console under Browser -> Inspect to see if theyre all working

- For loop through your array variable, and console log all of the values seperately.
    - Example:
    for (var i=0; i < weekdays.length; i++) {
        // This console logs all of our weekdays!
        console.log(weekdays[i])
    }

- Console log all of the different keys in your object, save, refresh, and check your console to make sure youre logging the correct values.

- Push to github

- Bonus: Add an 'if statement' or a conditional using your object.
    - Example:
    var likesDinner = true
  
    if (likesDinner == true) {
        console.log("I like dinner")
    } else {
        console.log("I dont like dinner")
    }
